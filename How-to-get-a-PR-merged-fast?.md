# How to get a PR merged fast?

Before you create a PR, you have to ask yourself a question: what am I looking to accomplish with it?

## Bug fixes

If your PR fixes an issue, it should contain at least one unit test that reproduces the error. Then the minimum code needed to fix the bug.

## New features

Do you have a cool feature in mind? Before you attempt to implement it, we ask you to create a new issue where you describe your new feature and why do you think it would be a good addition to the library.

If your idea is approved, here is your check list of needed steps for the PR:

* Unit tests
* The feature code
* Documentation for the new features
* Optionally a demo app for the docs (if it makes sense)

Please, don't open a PR for features without asking us yet. We don't want to waste your time.

## Documentation typos

This are the easy ones, just open a PR and it will probably be merged right away!

## Documentation demo

Do you feel like there is a missing key demo on the documentation? If so, please open an issue so we can discuss it.

If we feel the same thing, your PR with the demo will be merged super fast.

Having this in mind, if a PR follow this steps, it will be merged quite fast.
