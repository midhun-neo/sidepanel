# Towards 1.0.0

Before releasing the first stable version of this library (and using semver to track subsequent releases) we are going to push several intermediate releases:
* `alpha.0` - `alpha.9` - check content of previous releases in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* `alpha.10-x` - Subsequent alphas will contain datepicker improvements, smaller features, bug-fixes and the remaining component (scrollspy).
* `beta.0` - will be released when base functionality for all the core components is ready. Beta.0 might get released without completing work on animations, accessibility and keyboard navigation. Still, all the APIs should be in place. You can track progress towards beta.0 in the [dedicated milestone](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/milestone/4)
* `beta.1-x` - subsequent betas will contain bug-fixes and additional functionality (animations, accessibility, smaller features with no or small breaking changes)
* `rc.0` - to be released when the library is stable (no bugs reported for common scenarios - we still might have bugs for corner cases)
* `1.0.0` - No critical bugs reported for rc(s)
