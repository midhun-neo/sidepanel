# Towards 1.0.0

Before releasing the first stable version of this library (and using semver to track subsequent releases) we are going to push several intermediate releases:
* `alpha.0` - released on 2016-07-08, see [changelog](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-alpha0-2016-07-08).   
* `alpha.1-x` - releases to be done after Angular2 rc.4 is out. Those subsequent alphas will contain bug-fixes and the remaining components (datepicker, modal, scrollspy, timepicker, typeahead).
* `beta.0` - will be released when base functionality for all the core components is ready. Beta.0 might get released without completing work on animations and accessibility.
* `beta.1-x` - subsequent betas will contain bug-fixes and additional functionality (animations, accessibility, smaller features with no or small breaking changes)
* `rc.0` - to be released when the library is stable (no bugs reported for common scenarios - we still might have bugs for corner cases)
* `1.0.0` - Angular2 final released and no critical bugs reported for rc(s)
