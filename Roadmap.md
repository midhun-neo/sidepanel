# Towards 1.0.0

Before releasing the first stable version of this library (and using semver to track subsequent releases) we are going to push several intermediate releases:
* alpha.0 - initial, very first release with the following components: accordion, alert, collapse, dropdown, pager, pagination, progressbar, rating, tabset. Documentation site up.   
* alpha.1-x - releases to be done after Angular2 rc.2 is out. Those subsequent alphas will contain bug-fixes and the remaining components (buttons, carousel, tooltip/popovers, modal, scrollspy).
* beta.0 - will be released when base functionality for all the core components is ready. Beta.0 might get released without completing work on animations and accessibility.
* beta.1-x - subsequent betas will contain bug-fixes and additional functionality (animations, accessibility, smaller futures with no or small breaking changes)
* rc.0 - to be released when the library is stable (no bugs reported for common scenarios - we still might have bugs for corner cases)
* 1.0.0 - Angular2 final released and no critical bugs reported for rc(s)
